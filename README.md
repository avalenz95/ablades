## ðŸ”­ What I'm working on:
 - [**Relevant for Reddit**](https://github.com/ablades/relevant) - This is my current passion project that I've been working on for quite awhile and I love it! The web app is meant to fill a niche in an era of information overload. You can think of it as a Google Alerts for Reddit. It utilizes Golang, React/Redux, Docker, MongoDB, Reddit API, Custom Data Structures, Concurrency and a plethora of more things. If you'd like to learn more about it, check out the github or my website!
